1. Open your project's root directory in your terminal.

2. Run the following command to install `react-router-dom` as a project dependency:

   ```bash
   npm install react-router-dom

Once the installation is complete, you can start using react-router-dom in your project.
Understanding Routing

Routing is a key concept in web applications. It allows you to define different "routes" within your application, each of which corresponds to a specific URL or view. Routing is essential for creating multi-page applications or managing different views within a single-page application.

react-router-dom provides components and tools to help you define and manage routes in your React application. You can define routes, specify which components should render for each route, and pass data and parameters between components.

Layout Component
A layout component is a fundamental concept in many React applications. It represents a common structure or layout that surrounds the main content of your application. Layout components are often used to provide a consistent header, footer, navigation menu, or any other elements that should appear on multiple pages.

In the context of react-router-dom, a layout component can be used to create a consistent layout structure for your application. For example, you might have a Layout component that includes a navigation menu and a footer. This layout component can be used to wrap individual route components, ensuring that the navigation and footer are displayed on every page.

Feel free to customize your routing and layout components according to your project's specific needs. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!
